### Step 1 : Copying Git Repository

- Git refers to copying a repository as "cloning" it. 
- When you clone a repository, you create a connection between the origin and your local system.
- Cloning is a one-time operation.
- Refer Git clone [here](learn-git-in-30-minutes.md).



### Step 2 : Branch Creation

Branching is one of the best ways to get the most out of Git for version control. Branching in Git allows you to:

- Have several teams working from a single repository concurrently.

- Have team members anywhere in the world using Bitbucket Cloud to collaborate.

- Have multiple lines of development running at the same time independent of each other without needing code freezes.

- Refer Branching [here.](learn-git-in-30-minutes.md)
