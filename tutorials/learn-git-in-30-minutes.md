***Introduction***

- Git is a collection of command line utilities that track and record changes in files.
- With it you can restore old versions of your project, compare, analyse, merge changes and more. 
- This process is referred to as **version control**. 
- Git is decentralized, which means that it doesn't depend on a central server to keep old versions of your files. 
- Instead it works fully locally by storing this data as a folder on your hard drive, which we call a **repository**. 
- However you can store a copy of your repository online, which makes it easy for multiple people to collaborate and work on the same code. 
- Git Hub is used for this purpose.



***Git Clone***

- If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the `git clone` command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy. 
- Cloning is generally a one-time operation. 
- Once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations and collaborations are managed through their local repository.
